# OPTIMADE APIs for materials discovery datasets

This repository ingests and implements an OPTIMADE API for the datasets associated with:

- [Novel inorganic crystal structures predicted using autonomous simulation agents](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01438-8) by Ye *et al.*., which is archived on [Figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19601956.v1),
- [Rapid discovery of stable materials by coordinate-free coarse graining](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abn4117) by Goodall *et al.*, which is archived on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6345276).
